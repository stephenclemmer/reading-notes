I was in 201 and have skimmed this article again.

## How I explained REST to my brother

**Who is Roy Fielding?**
He helped write the first web servers, that sent documents across the internet… and then he did a ton of research explaining why the web works the way it does. His name is on the specification for the protocol that is used to get pages from servers to your browser.

**Why don’t the techniques that we use today work well when we need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the world?**
Because they weren't designed to be used like that. When Fielding and his colleagues started building the web, being able to talk to any machine anywhere in the world was a primary concern. But most of the techniques developers later used to get computers to talk to each other didn't have those requirements.

**What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created?**
HTTP is a general purpose protocol designed to have machines talk with one another.

**What does a GET do?**
Systems revtrieve information from one another by using HTTP GET.

**What does a POST do?**
Systems add something to another system by using an HTTP POST.

**What does PUT do?**
Systems replace something in anothe rsyste, by using HTTP PUT.

**What does PATCH do?**
Systems partially update other systems by using HTTP PATCH.

## API Keys
