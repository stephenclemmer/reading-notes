## React Docs - lists and keys

**What does .map() return?**
.map() returns an array the same length as the array is cycles through.

**If I want to loop through an array and display each value in JSX, how do I do that in React?**
One can use the aa.map() function to loop through an array, affect its elements, and treturn an array of the same length with new elements.

**Each list item needs a unique ____.**
key

**What is the purpose of a key?**
Keys help React identify which items have changed, are added, or are removed. Keys should be given to the elements inside the array to give the elements a stable identity

## The Spread Operator

**What is the spread operator?**
The spread operator is a useful and quick syntax for adding items to arrays, combining arrays or objects, and spreading an array out into a functionâ€™s arguments. It looks like an elipse, i.e., "..."

**List 4 things that the spread operator can do.**
- Copying an array
- Concatenating or combining arrays
- Using Math functions
- Using an array as arguments
- Adding an item to a list
- Adding to state in React
- Combining objects
- Converting NodeList to an array

**Give an example of using the spread operator to combine two arrays.**
const myArr1 = [1, 2, 3]
const myArr2 = [4, 5, 6]
const myArr3 = [...myArr1, ...myArr2]
console.log(myArr3)// 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6

**Give an example of using the spread operator to add a new item to an array.**
const myArr1 = [1, 2, 3]
const addItems = [4, 5, ...myArr1]
console.log(myArr1)// 1, 2, 3, 4, 5

**Give an example of using the spread operator to combine two objects into one.**
const objectOne = {hello: yes}
const objectTwo = {world: also yes}
const objectThree = {...objectOne, ...objectTwo}
console.log(objectThree) // Object { hello: yes, {world: also yes }

## How to Pass Functions Between Components

**In the video, what is the first step that the developer does to pass functions between components?**
Create a function at the level where the state is occurring.

**In your own words, what does the increment function do?**
The increment function increments the value of somomething my one, or determines the next thing to happen.

**How can you pass a method from a parent component into a child component?**
invoke a function using props, and pass along a name associated with the component to be affected.

**How does the child component invoke a method that was passed to it from a parent component?**
The state change causes a rerender which passes down the new value through props.
