## CSS Transitions & Animations

**What does a CSS transition allow the developer to do to an element?**
CSS transitions provide a way to control animation speed when changing CSS properties. Instead of having property changes take effect immediately, you can cause the changes in a property to take place over a period of time.

**How does a CSS animation differ from a CSS transition?**
CSS transitions are generally best for simple from-to movements, while CSS animations are for more complex series of movements. For instance, a transition could be used to make an icon fade in, change color, grow or shrink, or spin. Animation would be used for a cartoon character whose mouth is animated to make syllable movements.
