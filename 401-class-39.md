# Redux - Additional Topics

## [Redux Toolkit (RTK)](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/introduction/getting-started)

**What concerns are addressed by Redux Toolkit?**

The Redux Toolkit package is intended to be the standard way to write Redux logic. It was originally created to help address three common concerns about Redux:

"Configuring a Redux store is too complicated"
"I have to add a lot of packages to get Redux to do anything useful"
"Redux requires too much boilerplate code"

**What does configureStore() do?**
configureStore(): wraps createStore to provide simplified configuration options and good defaults. It can automatically combine your slice reducers, adds whatever Redux middleware you supply, includes redux-thunk by default, and enables use of the Redux DevTools Extension.

**How would I use createSlice()?**

createSlice(): accepts an object of reducer functions, a slice name, and an initial state value, and automatically generates a slice reducer with corresponding action creators and action types.

## [MobX](https://mobx.js.org/getting-started.html)

**What is Mobx?**
MobX is a standalone library that can be used as a state-management tool.

**How does MobX make it “impossible” to produce an inconsistent state?**
MobX makes sure that everything that can be derived from the application state, will be derived. Automatically.

**[How would we build a reactive user interface?](https://medium.com/machine-words/introduction-to-reactive-programming-using-mobx-2c032cac818e)**
Use an observer opattern: This pattern consists of an observable object, that is, some object that contains data of interest, and which also maintains a list of subscribers called observers. When the data changes, the observable object notifies all of the observers that are currently subscribed.

**What take-away(s) did this tutorial provide?**
The makers of this product and its documentation are cautioning against not using the Redux Tool Kit, because of its ability to integrate much f the functionality that base users had to work wrd to achieve, and which often led to errors.
