# Component-Based Architecture & Props within React

## Component-Based Architecture

**What is a “component”?**
A component encapsulates functionality and behaviors of a software element into a reusable and self-deployable binary unit. A component is a modular, portable, replaceable, and reusable set of well-defined functionality that encapsulates its implementation and exporting it as a higher-level interface.

A component is a software object, intended to interact with other components, encapsulating certain functionality or a set of functionalities. It has an obviously defined interface and conforms to a recommended behavior common to all components within an architecture.

A software component can be defined as a unit of composition with a contractually specified interface and explicit context dependencies only. That is, a software component can be deployed independently and is subject to composition by third parties.

**What are the characteristics of a component?**

**- Reusability:** Components are usually designed to be reused in different situations in different applications. However, some components may be designed for a specific task.

**- Replaceable:** Components may be freely substituted with other similar components.

**- Not context specific:** Components are designed to operate in different environments and contexts.

**- Extensible:** A component can be extended from existing components to provide new behavior.

**- Encapsulated:** A A component depicts the interfaces, which allow the caller to use its functionality, and do not expose details of the internal processes or any internal variables or state.

**- Independent:** Components are designed to have minimal dependencies on other components.

**What are the advantages of using component-based architecture?**

**- Ease of deployment:** As new compatible versions become available, it is easier to replace existing versions with no impact on the other components or the system as a whole.

**- Reduced cost:** The use of third-party components allows you to spread the cost of development and maintenance.

**- Ease of development:** Components implement well-known interfaces to provide defined functionality, allowing development without impacting other parts of the system.

**- Reusable:** The use of reusable components means that they can be used to spread the development and maintenance cost across several applications or systems.

**- Modification of technical complexity:** A component modifies the complexity through the use of a component container and its services.

**- Reliability:** The overall system reliability increases since the reliability of each individual component enhances the reliability of the whole system via reuse.

**- System maintenance and evolution:** Easy to change and update the implementation without affecting the rest of the system.

**- Independent:** Independency and flexible connectivity of components. Independent development of components by different group in parallel. Productivity for the software development and future software development.


## What is Props and How to Use it in React

**What is “props” short for?**
“Props” is a special keyword in React, which stands for properties.

**How are props used in React?**
Props are used to pass data from one component to another.

1. Define an attribute and its value(data)
**2. Pass it to child component(s) by using Props**
3. Render the Props Data

**What is the flow of props?**
Uni-directional; one way from parent to child.
