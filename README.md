Mindset is one's perception of their abilities. A *fixed mindset* is a belief that one's abilities are unable to be affected, whereas a **growth minsdet** is a belief that one's abilities can be affected. ***A growth mindset is essential for success within the tech field.***

## Here are three reminders to help stay in a growth mindset

1. All error is human error. Computers are only able to do as they are told, so focus on the root of the problem and know that fixing the problem is in your power!
2. Everyone starts in complete darkness. Each new piece of information is another candle illuminating your path forward. If you get stuck for more than 15 minutes, ask for help!
3. Rely on the brilliance of your peers to help work through difficult problems. Post in the group slack channel, attend lab hours, and consult Google to learn how to identify and remove any barriers.
