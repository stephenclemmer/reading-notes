# Introduction to SQL

Relational databases are a two-dimensional representation of data, formatted as a table. SQL is a means for formatting queries to access specific data contained in a database. Its basic syntax is as follows:

SELECT column, another_table_column, …

FROM mytable

INNER JOIN another_table

    ON mytable.id = another_table.id

WHERE condition(s)

ORDER BY column, … ASC/DESC

LIMIT num_limit OFFSET num_offset;
