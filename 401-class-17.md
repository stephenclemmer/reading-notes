# AWS: S3 and Lambda

## AWS S3

**What is Amazon S3?**
Amazon S3 or Amazon Simple Storage Service is a service offered by Amazon Web Services that provides object storage through a web service interface. Amazon S3 uses the same scalable storage infrastructure that Amazon.com uses to run its e-commerce network
-wikipedia.

This is how AWS can partitiopn its servers to secureley store data from multiple clients within an object. Data is store dwithin buckets. A bucket is a container to hold objects.

**Name some use cases for Amazon S3.**

S3 is an easy-to-use, scalable, and cheap storage service from Amazon. You can use S3 to store any amount of data for a wide range of use cases including static website hosting, data archival, and software delivery.

**Name some benefits of using Amazon S3.**
Its easy to use, cheap, and scalable. 

## AWS Lambda Basics

**What is AWS Lambda?**
AWS Lambda is a serverless computing service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS). Users of AWS Lambda create functions, self-contained applications written in one of the supported languages and runtimes, and upload them to AWS Lambda, which executes those functions in an efficient and flexible manner.

**Name some use cases for AWS Lambdas.**
When applications pnly need to run for a short time and each task is self contained, and the amount of workload that can happen has a large delta, then Lambda is a good fit. It means that one doesn;t need to invest in a server that runs all the time, the application can just run by using the system that Lambda provides, and it can scale as needed as a server would, but without having to cinstantly scale up and down.

**Describe “serverless” to a non-technical friend.**

Servers are still involved, but Serverless means that Lambda provides the infrastructure needed to run the application. The only thing that one has to do is upload the application and Lambda handles all of the processing, storage, and anythigng wlse needed to run the program.

## CDN

**What is a CDN?**
A Content Delivery Network (CDN) is a geographically distributed group of servers that work together to provide fast delivery of Internet content. A CDN allows for the fast transfer of data needed for loading Internet content including HTML pages, javascript files, stylesheets, images, and videos.

**How does a CDN work with relation to the website visitor?**
CDNs work through servers nearest to the website visitor respond to the request. i.e., Instead of a user in London trying to access a server in LA, which can cause slower Internet speeds, the user would be redirected through a CDN that is geographically closest to them

**What are the benefits of employing a CDN?**

1. Faster web speeds
2. More secure against cyber attacks
