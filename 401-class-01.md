# Node Ecosystem

**How would you describe Node to a non-technical friend?**

Node runs in the browser. Node is event-based, meaning that as soon as Node starts its server, it simply initiates its variables, declares functions and then simply waits for event to occur. Node is non-blocking and asynchronous, meaning the program that does not block the execution of further operations. Non-Blocking methods are executed asynchronously. Asynchronously means that the program may not necessarily execute line by line. This is where the event loop comes into play.

**What does it mean that Node is a JavaScript runtime?**
Javascript runtime refers to where your javascript code is executed when you run it. In my case , since Iâ€™m using Google Chrome, my node javascript runtime is the V8 Engine.

**What is Node used for?**
Node lets one run JavaScript in the browser. It also has a bunch of built in tools and features that make modern web apps function. Node manages the different tasks, and passes them to the event loop accordingly.
