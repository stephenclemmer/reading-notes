# The Growth Mindset

When it comes to improving, one should not practice what they know. They should instead practice what they don't know. One of the areas where I can apply deliberate practice is my ability to type without looking at my keyboard. I will be using typing.io to push my comfort level by going through the exercises slowly and deliberately, practice at least once each day for ten minutes, receive and incorporate feedback from my results, and set goals and track my improvement.

I maintain a growth mindset. I know that my abilities and understanding are not static. Over the last two months, this has been reinforced by my ability to progressively encode the information I am learning. The time between when I learn a concept to the time when I begin to understand a concept has been about two weeks, and I expect that I will continue to grow in this way during the 401 expereince. Without the grit to continue on through these experiences, I would not have gotten to my current understanding. I expect 401 to be more difficult than the courses I have taken thus far in the series, and I will meet this class with the grit that has carried me through to this point.

I have redefined my success in the knowledge that I am able to apply to the world around me. In this way, I have already succeeded, and my continued success will be celebrated with each increment of growht, however large or small it may be.

I am greatful to have been blessed with empathy and life expereinces that have helped shape my emotional intelligence. I have come to fully embrace coding as a team sport. I will also contonue to reach out to my classmates to see if there is anything I can do to assist them.
