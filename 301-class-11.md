# nosql vs sql

Five differences between SQL and NoSQL databases:

SQL:

1. Primarily called as Relational Databases (RDBMS.
2. Table-based
3. Predefined Schema
4. Vertically scalable
5. Uses SQL ( structured query language ) for defining and manipulating the data

NoSQL:

1. Primarily called as non-relational or distributed database.
2. Document-Based
3. Dynamic Schema
4. Horizontally scalable
5. In NoSQL database, queries are focused on collection of documents. Sometimes it is also called as UnQL (Unstructured Query Language). The syntax of using UnQL varies from database to database.
 	 
**What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database?**
SQL databases are good fit for the complex query intensive environment: Oracle Express Edition, MS-SQL Server Express Edition, and MySQL Community Edition.


**What kind of data is a good fit a NoSQL database?**
 NoSQL databases are not good fit for complex queries: Mongo DB, Couch DB, Redis

**Which type of database is best for hierarchical data storage?**
NoSQL database fits better for the hierarchical data storage as it follows the key-value pair way of storing data similar to JSON data. 

**Which type of database is best for scalability?**
I depends on the organization. In most typical situations, SQL databases are vertically scalable. You can manage increasing load by increasing the CPU, RAM, SSD, etc, on a single server. On the other hand, NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable. You can just add few more servers easily in your NoSQL database infrastructure to handle the large traffic.
