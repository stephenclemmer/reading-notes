# Data structures and Algorithms

**What is 1 of the more important things you should consider when deciding which data structure is best suited to solve a particular problem?**

Big O notation is one of the things that should be considered when choosing a data structure. Its consideration will affect how efficient, and how long, the code will run.

**How can we ensure that weâ€™ll avoid an infinite recursive call stack?**

By remembering to create a Base Case for a function, then a function that uses recursion will have defined a moment when it will stop running.
