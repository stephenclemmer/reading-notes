# ES6 Classes & Express Routing

## Review: ES6 Classes

**Classes are a template for creating ____.**
Objects.

**Can a class declaration be hoisted?**

No. Classes must be defined before they can be constructed. 

**How would you describe a constructor and contextual “this” to a non-technical friend?**

Constructors create objects. An object is a set of, typically, noun/adjective pairs that represent the qualities of the object. For instance, I may want to make an object that represents a dog. It might look like this:

{
  nose: cold,
  color: 'brown',
  words: 'woof',
  legs: 4
}

A constructor function is a type of machine that can take in parameters and create an object. If I wanted to make a whole bunch of dogs, I could feed those qualities into the machine and a bunch of different types of dogs would pop out with their unique qualites for nose, color, words, and legs. This saves a lot of time and allows one the ability to create a lot of things really quickly. 

The word "this" is used in a constructor function to refer to the object that is being created. In the case of our dog, "this" is referencing that particuklar instance of dog.


## Using Express Routing

**Within Express, what does routing refer to?**

Routing refers to how an application's endpoints respond to client requests.

**What is the difference between a route path and a route method?**
A route method is derived from one of the HTTP methods, and is attached to an instance of the express class.

Route paths, in combination with a request method, define the endpoints at which requests can be made. Route paths can be strings, string patterns, or regular expressions.

**When is it appropriate to add next as a parameter to a route handler and what must you do if next has been passed to your middleware as a parameter?**
One should use 'next' to bypass the ramining route callbacks. If next has been passed as middleware as a paramter. Next will need to be called to allow the function to continue on to its next thing to process.

## Express Routing

**What is an Express Router?**
It is a built in functionality within Express that provides routing APIs like .use, .get, .param, and route.

**By what mean do we initialize express.Router() in an express server?**
One may declare a variable to refer to express.Router() and access its routing APIs as methods. i.e, 

const router = express.Router();

router.get('/', function(req, res) { ...

**What do we use route middleware for?**
Route middleware in Express is a way to do something before a request is processed. This could be things like checking if a user is authenticated, logging data for analytics, or anything else we’d like to do before we actually spit out information to our user.
