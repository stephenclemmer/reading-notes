## An Introduction to Node.js on sitepoint.com

***What is node.js?**
Node.js is an event-based, non-blocking, asynchronous I/O Javascript runtime that uses Google’s V8 JavaScript engine and libuv library.

**In your own words, what is Chrome’s V8 JavaScript Engine?**
It changes Javascript code into language that the computer can understand.

**What does it mean that node is a JavaScript runtime?**
Runtime is a piece of code that implements portions of a programming language's execution model. In doing this, it allows the program to interact with the computing resources it needs to work.

**What is npm?**
NPM ios the package manager for JavaScript. A package manager keeps track of what software is installed on your computer, and allows you to easily install new software, upgrade software to newer versions, or remove software that you previously installed. Additionally, npm is the world's largest software registry.
**What version of node are you running on your machine?**
18.7.0

**What version of npm are you running on your machine?**
8.15.0

**What command would you type to install a library/package called ‘jshint’?**
npm install -g jshint

**What is node used for?**
Node runs various build tools designed to automate the process of developing as JS application including. It manages the processing of data so that it is more efficient on the back end

## 6 Reasons for Pair Programming

**What are the 6 reasons for pair programming?**

1. Greater efficiency
2. Engaged collaboration
3. Learning from fellow students
4. Social Skills
5. Job readiness
6. Work environment readiness

**In your experience, which of these reasons have you found most beneficial?**
Greater efficiency is the reason that has been most beneficial to me thus far. For instance, during our 201 project, Adrian navigated while I drove. He has about three years of experience under his belt and was able to better see the big picture, and plan a solution. He also had the vocabulary and experience needed to already understand how to use methosds to get the code to function. I understood a small percentage of what he was doing, but I learned a bit too by being part of it. Most importantly, to do what we did together would have taken me days to figure out, whereas we were able to work together for only a couple hours and come up with a solution to our problem. 

**How does pair programming work?**
Pair programming is the practice of two developers sharing a single workstation to interactively tackle a coding task together. The more experienced coder navigates, and the less experienced programmer drives. The navigator dictates what to type, and the driver types it, manges the text editor, version control, and switching files. The navigatior thinks about the big picture, how an algorithim may be converted to code, watches for potential bugs, and may research on their own machine to find solutions to problems.
