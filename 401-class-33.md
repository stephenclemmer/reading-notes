## [What is Role Based Access Control (RBAC)?](https://digitalguardian.com/blog/what-role-based-access-control-rbac-examples-benefits-and-more)

**What is Role Based Access Control (RBAC)?**
Role-based access control (RBAC) restricts network access based on a person's role within an organization. Employees are only allowed access to information necessary to perform their role. 

**Share some an example of RBAC including all possible CRUD operations and correlating roles.**
The Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) functionality, is an excellent way to manage data, and people's roles with that data. It allows people to access what they need, and have limited power that might keep them from purposely or inadvertantly affecting the data negatively. The specifics of each role in a paerticular company may vary, but some examples u=include. 

Front line employees (who need to read or create data)
Human Resources (who need to also update data)
Administrator/Executive (who may need to update data, or delete it)
IT (who needs to be able to manipulate data people across a company)
Managers may have additional access, and their subordinates may need to request a manager to access update or delete functionality since they may mutate the data permenantly. 

**What are the Benefits of RBAC?**
RBAC helps employees and employers manage their liability by ensuring that access to information is kept on a need to know basis. It allows people to easily gain or lose control, and helps keep organizations from needing to make sure that new employees are onboarded completely and that old employees are removed from all access. 

## Compare and Contrast the following two Libraries and the following questions. (Yes, they are similarly named.)

[react-cookie library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-cookie)
[react-cookies component](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-cookies)

I believe that these libraries allow one to setup and manipulate cookies to help keep users from needing to tax a server by keeping certain information i local storage.

**Describe some react-cookie features.**

get all

**Describe some react-cookies features.**

load all

**Which library would you prefer would you prefer? Why?**

I do not yet know enough to have a preference.
