**Whatâ€™s the relationship between REST and CRUD?**

CRUD functions can exist within a REST API architecture. However, Rest APIs can be independent of any of the CRUB functions because in some instances, such a rebooting a server, they don't have to use CRUD to do so. Their functions may be similar, but they do different things. The best way to differentiate between them is to remember that REST is a standard (an API architecture), and CRUD is a function.
