## Assignment Operators:

An assignment operator assigns a value to its left operand based on the value of its right operand. The simple assignment operator is equal (=), which assigns the value of its right operand to its left operand. 

Question: left and right shift operators? What does that look like?

## Comparison Operators: 
A comparison operator compares its operands and returns a logical value based on whether the comparison is true. The operands can be numerical, string, logical, or object values.

## Expression: 
An expression is any valid unit of code that resolves to a value.
Primary Expresseions: Basic keywords ans general expressions in JavaScript.

## Truth Tables: 
A diagram in rows and columns showing how the truth or falsity of a proposition varies with that of its components.

&& :Compares two expressions and returns rue if they are all true
|| :Compares two expressions and returns true if at least one is true

These are Boolean values, either true or false.

## Nesting Functions:

## Loops: Loops offer a quick and easy way to do something repeatedly. 

While (thisconditionEvasluatesToTrue){do this}

for (TheInitialValue; – thisconditionEvasluatesToTrue; increment;){do this}
