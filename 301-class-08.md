# API Design Best Practices

**What does REST stand for?**
Representational State Transfer (REST)

**REST APIs are designed around a ____.**
REST APIs are designed around resources, which are any kind of object, data, or service that can be accessed by the client.

**What is an identifier of a resource? Give an example.**
A resource has an identifier, which is a URI that uniquely identifies that resource. For example, the URI for a particular customer order might be:

https://adventure-works.com/orders/1

**What are the most common HTTP verbs?**
GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE.

**What should the URIs be based on?**
When possible, resource URIs should be based on nouns (the resource) and not verbs (the operations on the resource).

**Give an example of a good URI.**
https://adventure-works.com/orders // Good

https://adventure-works.com/create-order // Avoid

**What does it mean to have a ‘chatty’ web API? Is this a good or a bad thing?**
Chatty is a bad thing. It basically means that the API has to send multiple pieces of information rather than it being available all at once.

**What status code does a successful GET request return?**
200 (OK)

**What status code does an unsuccessful GET request return?**
204 (No Content)

**What status code does a successful POST request return?**
201 (Created)

**What status code does a successful DELETE request return?**
204 (No Content)
